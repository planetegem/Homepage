        The Maze Base, the place where mazes come to graze: be hypnotized by maze generation algorithms in action!
    </p>
    <p>
        Algorithms will be added from time to time, so be sure to come back every so often: 
        once every hour should be enough to catch every update.

        <h2>What? Why? How?!</h2>
        <p>
            I wanted 2 things from this project: (1) an excuse to familiarize myself with Typescript and (2) a playground to have fun with maze generation algorithms.
            </br>
            This meant a simple framework to add new algorithms, as I didn't want to have to revisit the base mechanics of the page whenever I wanted to add a new algorithm.
        </p>
        <p>
            The result was achieved with an object-oriented approach.
            A basic class provides the methods to generate a coordinate field and draw the maze on a canvas,
            which is then extended with the algorithm that generates the maze (the recursion method).
            An animation function takes a maze class as argument. 
            <br>
            When calling the constructor of the maze class, a 3D array is created to represent the maze (a 2D maze extended along a time dimension).
            The animation function then uses the internal draw method of the class to interpret the 2D maze on a canvas, as it changes along the time dimension.
