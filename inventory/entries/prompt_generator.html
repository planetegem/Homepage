        <h2>What? Why? How?!</h2>
        <p>
            A prompt generator would be an integral part in my next game, which I wanted to build in PHP. 
            <br>
            I knew that I would need lists of words which could be combined by an algorithm to create prompts.
            For this reason, I chose to use an SQL database to contain these lists.
        </p>
        <p>
            To be able to create the lists of words, I first built an interface. 
            Logging in gives the user access to a form to add new words with specific parameters. 
            Entries can also be updated or deleted if necessary.
            <br>
            Once the interface was there, I got to work on the algorithm, which consists of 2 parts:
            (1) a javascript side which requests words and combines them and
            (2) a php side which handles the request and responds with an object pulled from the MySQL db.
            For easy testing, I made the 2 sides communicate at every step, so you can follow the thinking process in the console.
