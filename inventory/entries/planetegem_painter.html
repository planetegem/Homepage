        <h2>What? Why? How?!</h2>
        <p>
           I built the Planetegem Painter to experiment with dynamically placing images on a webpage (i.e. dragging & dropping, scaling, rotating, etc).
            <br>
            While I was at it, I figured it would also be fun to add some canvas elements and give the users pencils to draw with.
        </p>
        <p>
            All in all, this was a simple project, but it did start the gestation of my next big project: Prove you're a Robot.
