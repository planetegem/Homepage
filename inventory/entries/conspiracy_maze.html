        Navigate through a vast conspiracy maze. All mazes have been procedurally generated and are filled with joy!
        Unfortunately, this one is not supported for mobile.

        This game has been built entirely in HTML5 canvas. All coding is custom: no libraries were used.

        <h2>What? Why?!</h2>
        <p>
            I had several ambitions for this game:
            <br>
            (1) I wanted a game where you had to navigate procedurally generated mazes 
            (2) with pixel perfect collision detection 
            (3) and gameplay changing from level to level (i.e. top-down navigation, into a platformer, into a gravity tumbler).
            <br>
            Having practically no coding experience at the time, this was a major challenge.
