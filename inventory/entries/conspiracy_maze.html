        Navigate through a vast conspiracy maze. All mazes have been procedurally generated and are filled with joy!
        Unfortunately, this one is not (yet) supported for mobile.

        This is the first game I built entirely with the HTML5 canvas!

        <h2>What? Why? How?!</h2>
        <p>
            I had several ambitions for this game:
            </br>
            (1) I wanted a game where you had to navigate procedurally generated mazes 
            (2) with pixel perfect collision detection 
            (3) and gameplay changing from level to level (i.e. top-down navigation, into a platformer, into a gravity tumbler).
            </br>
            Having practically no coding experience at the time, this was a major challenge for me.
        </p>
        <p>Details about how I solved this can be found in the accompanying readme on github.</p>
