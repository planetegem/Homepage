        Political Memory is back, now with 12 politicians and 7 random events! 
        Can you find them all? More cards and events will be added as time goes by.

        A desktop-only version of the game is available on itch, which will be updated most frequently. 
        A mobile version can be played locally.

        <h2>Why and how</h2>
        <p>
            I had wanted to revisit Political Memory for a while to add some more complexity to its gameplay in the form of random events.
            I also wanted the game to feel more like a stand-alone app, instead of the rather basic webpage it was.
            Finally, game progress needed to be made persistent by saving it in browser local storage.
            <br>
            Doing this and learning React at the same time seemed like a win/win.
        </p>
        <p>
            The biggest challenge here was the data being passed around between React components.
            As React works asynchronously, it was difficult to predict if the data inside components was up-to-date
            (for example if 2 different components were to trigger a render of the parent component at the same time).
