<h2>why and how?</h2>
<p>
    The goal of the Maze Base was to familiarize myself with Typescript and lean a bit more into OOP.
    I also wanted to a page that allows easy adding of new algorithms without having to revisit any of the basic mechanics of the page.
</p>
<p>
    The solution was a basic class which contained some standard methods (ie. create a coordinate field, helper functions, animation functions, etc).
    This base class is then extended whenever I add a new algorithm. Calling the constructor results in a 3D array (dimensions being x, y & time).
    This class is passed into a function that's called when clicking the play button. This is also where the canvas animations are handled (with methods inherited from the base class).
