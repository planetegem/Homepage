        Pretend to be an AI like Dall-e or Midjourney: can you draw faster than humans can type prompts?!

        Created drawings can be uploaded to a central database, where they can be viewed by everyone.

            "Prove you're a Robot" provides similar drawing mechanics to the Planetegem Painter, but this time with a clear objective for the player:
            a prompt is requested from the Prompt Generator project, which the player then has to draw.
        </p>
        <p>
            Important for this game was that there needed to be a community aspect: 
            a combination of prompt and drawing needed to be saved on the server, so players would be able to share their art with each other.
            Other than that, it was mostly just finetuning of the methods used in the Planetegem Painter and the Prompt Generator.
